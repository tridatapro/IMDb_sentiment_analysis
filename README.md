# IMDb_sentiment_analysis
During the project "Unmasking the Hidden Emotions: Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews," I conducted an in-depth analysis of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing techniques. By applying sentiment analysis algorithms to a large dataset of IMDb movie reviews, I aimed to uncover the underlying emotions and sentiments expressed by viewers. Leveraging Python programming and machine learning libraries, I processed and analyzed the text data, identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments associated with different movies. This project allowed me to gain valuable insights into the audience's perceptions and emotions towards various films, showcasing my expertise in NLP and data analysis.
